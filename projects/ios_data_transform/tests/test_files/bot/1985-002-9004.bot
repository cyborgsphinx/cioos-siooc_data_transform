*COMMENTS

    Sample collection methods:
    --------------------------
      Sea Water Temperature:
      - Reversing thermometers mounted on bottles.
      Salinity:
      - Collected in bottles.
      Dissolved Oxygen:
      - Collected in bottles.
      Reactive Nutrients (Phosphate, nitrate, silicate):
      - Collected in bottles

    Analyzes methods:
    -------------------------
      Temperatures at depth were measured by deep-sea reversing thermometers of
      German (Richter and Wiese) and/or Japanese (Yoshimo Keiki Co.) manufacture.
      Two protected thermometers were used on all bottles, and one unprotected
      thermometer was used on each bottle at depths of 300 m or greater. The
      accuracy of protected reversing thermometers is believed to be +-0.02C.

      Salinity determinations were made at sea with either a Guildline Autosal
      salinometer. Accuracy using duplicate determinations is estimated to be
      +-0.003 ppt.

      Depth determinations were made using the "depth difference" method
      described in the U.S.N. Hydrographic Office Publication No. 607 (1955).
      Depth estimates have an approximate accuracy of +-5 m for depths less than
      1000 m, and +-0.5% of depth for depths greater than 1000 m.

      The dissolved oxygen analyses were done in the shipboard laboratory by a
      modified Winkler method (Carpenter, 1965).

      Nutrient samples were frozen for analyzes ashore.

      Chlorophyll and nutrients were analyzed using methods from Bulletin 125
      Fisheries Research Board of Canada 1960 "A manual of seawater analysis"
      J.D.H. Strickland and T.R. Parsons, and subsequent editions.

      Tritium data reported in Data Release #86-24 from the Tritium Laboratory
      at the University of Miami, April 24, 1986. Data reported in TU18N values
      which are the TU ratios in the "NEW" scale that the sample would have had
      on 1981/01/01. The C13 and C14 data were also reported in the same Data
      Release. Further information available in the Data Release found in the
      \DOC directory.
