    Analysis methods:
    -----------------
        Chlorophyll samples were filtered onto 25mm GF/F filters and stored in glass
        scintillation vials in liquid nitrogen (onboard) and then at -80C (at IOS)
        prior to analysis. Samples were extracted in 90% acetone at -20C for 24 hours
        in the lab and analyzed on a Turner 10AU fluorometer calibrated with
        commercially pure chlorophyll a standard (Sigma).
        Fluorescence readings taken before and after acidification were used to
        calculate chlorophyll and phaeopigment concentrations (Holm-Hansen et al 1965).
        Chlorophyll samples were analyzed at IOS in Room 2423 ~3 weeks after the cruise.
        The average of two samples is reported. Variability is assessed as the
        CV% (std dev / mean*100).
        Flags and comments apply to chlorophyll values only.
        Precision Statement: Chlorophyll values ranged from 1.23-7.51ug/l. Average %CV for
          this cruise was 2.62% with 0 out of 11 duplicate pairs having a CV>10% and 0 out
          of 11 duplicate pairs having a CV>30%. Our average dataset %CV is 3.73 % for
          2013 - 2017 so the overall quality of this dataset is excellent.
        For details see worksheet “CV%” in file QF2018-96CHL*.xlsx.

        Nutrient samples were collected in plastic tubes and quick frozen in aluminum
        blocks stored in a -20C freezer.
        All analysis was performed on frozen samples.
        They were analyzed using an Astoria analyzer following methods described in
        IOS Nutrient Methods (1996) Barwell-Clarke, J. and F. Whitney.
        For details see document NUTS_QF2018-96*.xlsx.

        Salinity samples were collected in 200 mL type II glass bottles with disposable nylon
        inserts and screw caps supplied by Ocean Scientific International Limited.  They were
        analyzed in a temperature-controlled lab on a Guildline 8400B Salinometer
        standardized with IAPSO standard seawater within 13 to 17 days days after collection.
        For details, see document QF2018-96SAL*.xls.

        Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) was determined using coulometric analysis.
        Total alkalinity (Alk) was determined by potentiometric titration.
        Complete documentation on DIC, ALK analysis and precision estimates can be found in
        in the Metadata section of document QF2018-96_DIC*.xlsx.

        Note that samples with nominal depth 0 were surface samples with no matching CTD
        data, so the shallowest available CTD data were chosen.

        CTD Data Processing Notes:
        --------------------------
        The CTD data in these files were extracted from CTD profile files after the
        recalibration of the CTD dissolved oxygen channels.

        Fluorescence, Dissolved Oxygen and pH:SBE data are nominal and unedited,
        except that some records were removed in editing temperature and salinity.

        Channel Fluorescence:URU:Wetlabs had some very small negative values in deep
        water which were set to 0 using program Calibrate.

        There were 8 deep salinity bottle samples during this cruise. The CTD salinity
        values were higher than the bottles by a median value of 0.0031psu which
        is within the expected accuracy. Some of this difference may be due to the
        fact that flushing of Niskin bottles is somewhat inefficient so that the
        water in the bottles may have come from slightly higher in the water column.
        A comparison with an SBE911+ cast during a previous cruise also showed that
        the salinity was likely within expected accuracy.
        No recalibration was applied to the CTD salinity.

        There was no dissolved oxygen sampling during this cruise or previous cruises
        using this equipment in 2017. An inter-ship comparison of 2 casts
        from a June 2017 cruise using these sensors with a cast from a cruise that
        did include calibration sampling, suggested that dissolved oxygen values were
        likely low by up to 4%. A comparison with an SBE911+ cast at the same site
        during a recent cruise had a lot of scatter but suggested that dissolved oxygen
        was reading low by at least 5%.
        Channel Oxygen:Dissolved:SBE was recalibrated by adding 5% to all values.

        WARNING: The pH:SBE:Nominal data should be used with caution; no field calibration
        data were available at the time of processing.
        Calibration is required for each cast to get absolute values, although general
        trends within a cast are likely real.

        For details on the processing see processing report: 2018-96-Processing_Report.doc.
