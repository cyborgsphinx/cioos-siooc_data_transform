CTD Data Processing Notes:
--------------------------

For full details see report "Physical, chemical and zooplankton data from the Canada Basin
and Canadian Arctic Archipelago, July 20 to September 14, 2006." cited below.

Standard seabird processing steps were used.

Temperature and conductivity were calibrated with the pre-cruise calibrations.
Oxygen and Fluorescence were calibrated to water samples.
Transmissometer and Altimeter are not calibrated.

Fluorometer notes:
Calibration with bottle data performed using bottle chlorophyll values between 0.025 and
0.6 mg/m3. The number of observations used were 36 out of 42 with a standard deviation of
0.02 in the residuals. Coefficients used: Slope: 0.402, Bias 0.0071. Alignment of -4 seconds
was used.

Oxygen Calibration:
A lag of -8 seconds was applied to oxygen voltage in Seabird data processing step Align.
The oxygen sensor membrane had attachment problems during cruise due to factory issues.
Numerous calibrations were necessary. For the 64 casts, 9 calibrations were applied. See
Table 7., page 25 in report "Physical, chemical and zooplankton data from the Canada Basin
and Canadian Arctic Archipelago, July 20 to September 14, 2006." cited below.

Data Notes:
- Although three oxygen sensors were swapped in and out during the cruise, the one sensor that
  performed well throughout has been labelled primary and the others have been removed from the
  final data.
- Two tranmsissometers were used for casts 49 to 75. They were repositioned on cast 64 changing
  the naming of which was called primary and which secondary. In summary:
  Casts 1-48, One Transmissometer, s/n 662
  Casts 49-63, Two Transmissometers, s/n 662 is now secondary, s/n 993 is primary
  Casts 64-75, Two Transmissometers, s/n 662 is primary again, s/n 993 is secondary
- Spikes in temperature, conductivity and oxygen have been linearly interpolated over and where
  needed secondary values (when available) have replaced the primary values.

Chemistry Sampling and Analysis Methods:
---------------------------------------

For full details see report "Physical, chemical and zooplankton data from the Canada Basin
and Canadian Arctic Archipelago, July 20 to September 14, 2006." cited below.

Salinity samples were collected in 200 mL type II glass bottles with disposable plastic
inserts and screw caps.  On board, samples were analyzed in a temperature-controlled lab
on a Guildline AutoSalinometer Model 8400A (SN: 49463), which was standardized with IAPSO
standard seawater. Onshore, samples were analyzed January 2007 on the Guildline
AutoSalinometer Model 8400B (SN: 68572), which was standardized with IAPSO standard seawater.

Oxygen samples were collected in glass flasks and analyzed on board on an automated
Micro-Winkler titration system following the procedures of Carpenter (1965). The titration
was performed with a Metrohn Dosimat 665 and the end point was detected using a Brinkmann
probe Colorimeter PC910 (SN: 910-358). Software written at the Institute of Ocean Sciences,
NewAutoOxy.exe, was used to calculate dissolved oxygen (ml/L).

Nutrient samples (nitrate plus nitrite, silicate and orthophosphate) were collected in glass
and polystyrene test tubes. If analysis could be performed within 24 hours the samples were
stored at 4 degree C, if not they were frozen at -20 degree C. Note that frozen nutrient
samples from casts 1 to 9, except a few samples from within casts 4, 5 and 7, thawed when the
freezer was accidentally turned off. The freezer had been off between 24 and 36 hours. The
samples were refrozen and analyzed later during the cruise, except the last 3 casts (73-75) run
at the Institute of Ocean Sciences, February 2008, from frozen samples. Samples were analyzed
fresh on board. Samples were not filtered. Samples were analyzed using a Technicon auto-analyzer
following methods described in Barwell-Clarke and Whitney (1996).

Total Chlorophyll-a (>0.7um) samples were collected into 2 L brown Nalgene sample bottles,
immediately placed in dark bags and stored in a fridge. Samples were filtered onto 25mm GF/F
filters using low vacuum filtration. The filters were put in scintillation vials and stored
at -20 degree C until analysis at the Institute of Ocean Sciences, December 2006. For analysis,
10 ml of 90% acetone was added to the scintillation vial which was then put into a -20 degree C
freezer for 24 hours. The samples were allowed to adjust to room temperature for an hour before
being read with the fluorometer. Chlorophyll-a and phaeo-pigment levels were measured with a
Turner Designs fluorometer (model 10-000R, s/n 0329R). The sample was acidified with 2 drops of
1N hydrochloric acid to obtain the phaeo-pigment reading.

Oxygen Isotopes Samples were collected into 30 ml glass vials. Once at room  temperature, the
caps were retightened and wrapped with parafilm for storage. Samples were analyzed January
to April 2007 at the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science Technology using the H2O-CO2
equilibration method on a Finnigan MAT 252 mass spectrometer.

Barium samples were collected in ~20 ml plastic vials. Once at room temperature the caps were
retightened for storage. Barium concentrations were determined at Oregon State University,
using isotope-dilution and a VG Thermo Excel Inductively coupled quadrupole mass spectrometer
as previously described with minor modifications (Falkner et al., 1994).

Phytoplankton and bacterioplankton were collected in 2 ml capacity cryogenic vial and fixed with
0.2 ml of 10% paraformaldehyde by vortex mixing. Samples were maintained for at least 15 min at
laboratory temperature to allow fixation, and then stored at -80 degree C until analysis at the
Bedford Institute of Oceanography. Cell concentrations of picophytoplankton, nanophytoplankton,
and bacterioplankton (i.e. non-autofluorescent picoplankton) in thawed samples were analyzed by
flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson FACSort) following protocols in routine use (Li and Dickie, 2001).

Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC) and Alkalinity:
  DIC and Alkalinity were collected into 250 or 500 mL glass bottles. Samples were kept at
  4 degree C until analysis and preserved with HGCL2 (except for the alkalinity being run on
  board).

  Alkalinity ("Alkalinity:Total") and DIC ("Carbon:Dissolved:Inorganic") were measured from the
  same sample bottle at select stations. In addition, more frequent samples of Alkalinity were
  collected at most stations and have been labelled "Alkalinity:Total:Potentiometric" to
  distinguish this set of separate samples, even though both sets of Alkalinity samples were
  measured using potentiometric titration.

  DIC was analyzed at the Institute of Ocean Sciences using a SOMMA (Single-Operator
  Multi-Metabolic Analyzer) - Coulometer system to determine DIC.

  Alkalinity samples were analyzed using an automated potentiometric titration system to
  determine the total alkalinity. Alkalinity samples paired with DIC were sampled at the
  Institute of Ocean Sciences. The samples not paired with DIC were analyzed on board within
  48 hours of collection.

Iodine 129 samples were collected into 1 L PVC bottles Samples and returned to the Laboratory of
the Atlantic Environmental Radioactivity Unit (AERU) at the Bedford Institute of Oceanography
(BIO). In the laboratory, a NaI carrier was added to a 200 mL aliquot of the seawater sample, it
was slightly acidified, purified using multiple hexane extractions and iodine was precipitated
as NaI. The NaI precipitate was shipped to the IsoTrace Laboratory at the University of Toronto
where 129I analyses were performed by accelerator mass spectrometry (Smith et al. 1998; 1999; 2005).

Cesium 137 samples were collected into 10 L plastic carboys. The water samples were passed
through a potassium ferrocyanide (KCFC) packed resin column in the laboratory (AERU) which
quantitatively extracts 137Cs from seawater (Smith et al. 1990; Smith & Ellis 1995). The KCFC
resin was deployed in a standard geometry and measured using a hyperpure Ge detector having an
efficiency of 25%.

Halocarbons: CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113 and CCl4:
  Halocarbon samples were collected in a Perfektum 250 mL glass syringe (Popper & Sons Inc.).
  CFC-12, CFC-11, CFC-113, and CCl4 were analyzed at sea on the Institute of Ocean Sciences
  automated purge and trap system. Separation and detection of the components was achieved using
  a 60 m, 0.32 mm GasPro G fused silica column and a Hewlett Packard GC/Electron Capture
  Detector, respectively.

Particulate organic carbon (POC) samples were collected into 2 L Nalgene bottles. Onboard ship,
4 L samples were filtered onto 47 mm GF75 filters that had been pre-combusted at 500 degree C
for 4 hours. The filtration was performed within 4 hours of sampling unless otherwise noted.
Samples were analyzed at the University of British Columbia. The filters were first dried for
24 hours at 50 degree C, then fumed with HCl for 48 hours, dried again at 50 degree C for
24 hours, and then wrapped in aluminum foil and pressed into pellets. The pellets were run
through the CN analyzer where the POC was determined.

Ammonium samples were collected in 50 mL glass tubes, and analysed onboard following the Holmes
et al. (1999) fluorometric protocol. Samples were kept in the dark for 5 to 8 hours at room
temperature. Samples were then measured using a Turner Designs TD-700 fluorometer.
