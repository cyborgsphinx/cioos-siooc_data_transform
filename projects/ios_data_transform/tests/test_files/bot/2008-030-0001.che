 CTD Data Processing Notes:
 --------------------------

 Processing notes can be found in the DOC directory in folder "Individual Data Reports"
 (2008-30_CTD SBE911 Processing_v2017-12-18.docx).

 Standard seabird processing steps were used.

 CTD Pressure: Lab calibration was adjusted by applying +0.9dbar offset to the bias based
 on in-air surface readings of the CTD.

 CTD Temperature: Pre-cruise lab calibration was used after comparisons with dual sensor and
 post-cruise calibration information.

 CTD Conductivity: Pre-cruise lab calibration adjusted after comparisons with dual sensor,
 post-cruise calibrations and water sample data. For casts 1 to 43, primary conductivity
 received offset of -0.0013 mS/cm and secondary conductivity received offset of 0.0016 mS/cm.
 For casts 44 to 53, primary was changed by -0.0007 mS/cm and secondary conductivity was
 changed by 0.0018 mS/cm. For casts 54 to 73, primary was changed by -0.0004 mS/cm and
 secondary conductivity was changed by 0.0021 mS/cm.

 CTD Oxygen: Oxygen data are from three SeaBird SBE43 sensors which were installed for
 casts 1 to 5, 6 to 22 and 23 to 73 respectively. They were installed with pumped flow
 in-line after the primary temperature and conductivity sensors. A lag of -8 seconds was
 applied to oxygen voltage in the Seabird processing step Align. Downcast CTD oxygen voltage
 and upcast temperature and salinity were used to calibrate CTD to water sample oxygen
 (upcast). The 73 casts required 12 calibration groups. Fitting method followed Seabirds
 Application Note 64-2 (“SBE 43 Dissolved Oxygen Sensor Calibration and Data Corrections
 using Winkler Titrations”). A remaining pressure dependent shape in the residual between
 water sample and CTD oxygen was removed by subtracting a mean curve. Parts of the mean curve
 were found by fitting sections of data from discreet pressure ranges. The parts were then
 stitched together via spline interpolation to create a full profile mean curve.

 CTD Fluorometer: Fluorometer data are from a Seapoint sensor with pumped flow in-line after
 the secondary temperature and conductivity sensors. Calibration with bottle data performed
 using bottle chlorophyll values between 0.025 and 0.60 mg/m3. The number of observations used
 were 121 out of 177 with a standard deviation of 0.01 in the residuals. Coefficients used:
 Slope: 1.3324, Bias -0.0174. Alignment of -3 seconds was used.

 Transmissometer data are unprocessed, using calibration from 26 May 2008 (s/n 662) and 9 Jun
 2008 (s/n993).

 CTD CDOM Fluorometer data are unprocessed and given as raw voltage.

 Altimeter data are unprocessed, using calibration from Mar 2005.

 Data Notes:
 - Spikes in temperature, conductivity and oxygen have been linearly interpolated over
   and where needed secondary values (when available) have replaced the primary values.

 Transmissivity:
   During Collection:
     Casts 1-5,   Two Transmissometers, s/n 662 is primary, s/n 993 is secondary.
     Casts 6-34,  One Transmissometer, s/n 662 is primary and column of zeros for secondary.
                  Secondary channel was removed.
     Casts 35-73, Two Transmissometers, s/n 993 is now primary and 662 is secondary.
   Final Reported Files:
     All casts,   In the final files the channels were reordered so that the data from s/n 662
                  is in the Transmissivity channel and the data from s/n 993 is in the
                  Transmissivity2 channel.

 Oxygen:
   Casts 1-5,  Oxygen s/n 435;
   Casts 6-22  Oxygen s/n 1115;
   Casts 23-73 Oxygen s/n 398.
   Casts 9, 14-17, CTD oxygen removed due to failed sensor.

 Chemistry Sampling and Analysis Methods:
 ---------------------------------------

 Salinity samples were collected in 200 mL type II glass bottles with screw caps and
 disposable plastic inserts. On board, samples were analyzed in a temperature-controlled lab
 on a Guildline AutoSalinometer Model 8400B (SN: 69086), which was standardized with IAPSO
 standard seawater. Onshore, samples, 1546 to 1617, were analyzed 6 months later in a
 temperature-controlled lab on the Guildline AutoSalinometer Model 8400B (SN: 68572), which
 was standardized with IAPSO standard seawater.

 Oxygen samples were collected in glass flasks and analyzed at sea using an automated Scripps
 Institution of Oceanography (SIO) Winkler-based UV titration system, consisting of laptop with
 LVO2 software (v2.34), 2 Brinkmann 665 Dosimats, pencil UV lamp, UV100BQ photodiode detector,
 mini stirrer with a water bath sample holder mounted on top, 2 Platinum Resistance Thermometers
 (PRT) to monitor solution temperatures, an analogue to digital converter to convert voltages
 from the detector and the 2 PRTs to a digital signal. The methodology followed was as described
 in the SIO Oxygen Titration Manual Version 10-Apr-2003.

 Nutrient samples (nitrate plus nitrite, silicate and orthophosphate) were collected in
 polystyrene test tubes. If analysis could be performed within 24 hours the samples were
 stored at 4 degree C, if not they were frozen at -20 degree C. All samples were analyzed
 fresh on board using a Technicon auto-analyzer following methods described in Barwell-Clarke
 and Whitney (1996).

 Ammonium samples were collected in 40.5 mL glass tubes, and analyzed on board following the
 Holmes et al. (1999) fluorometric protocol. Samples were kept in the dark for 5 to 8 hours
 at room temperature. Samples were then measured using a Turner Designs TD-700 fluorometer.

 Oxygen Isotopes Samples were collected into 30 ml glass vials. Once at room  temperature, the
 caps were retightened and wrapped with parafilm for storage. Samples were analyzed at Oregon
 State University using the Thermo DeltaPlusXL mass spectrometer connected to a H2O-CO2
 equilibration unit. Samples were analyzed Feb to Apr 2009 (6 to 8 months after collection).

 Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC) and Alkalinity:
   DIC and Alkalinity were collected into 250 or 500 mL glass bottles. Samples were kept at
   4 degree C until analysis and preserved with HGCL2. Samples were analyzed Nov 2008 to
   Jan 2009 (3 to 5 months after collection).

   Alkalinity ("Alkalinity:Total") and DIC ("Carbon:Dissolved:Inorganic") were measured from the
   same sample bottle at select stations. In addition, more frequent samples of Alkalinity were
   collected at most stations and have been labelled "Alkalinity:Total:Potentiometric" to
   distinguish this set of separate samples, even though both sets of Alkalinity samples were
   measured using potentiometric titration.

   DIC was analyzed at the Institute of Ocean Sciences using a SOMMA (Single-Operator
   Multi-Metabolic Analyzer) - Coulometer system to determine DIC.

   Alkalinity samples were analyzed at the Institute of Ocean Sciences using an automated
   potentiometric titration system to determine the total alkalinity.

 Total Chlorophyll-a (>0.7um) samples were collected into 2 L polyethylene sample bottles,
 immediately placed in dark bags and stored in a fridge. Samples were filtered onto 25mm GF/F
 filters using low vacuum filtration. Samples were analyzed on board. Initially at the beginning
 of the cruise, all filters were immediately put into scintillation vials with 10 mL/L of 90%
 acetone (made with NANOpur water), labeled and put into a 4 °C cooler for 24 hours. Later, due
 to time constraints, the filters were preserved in the -20 °C freezer in scintillation vials until
 they could be processed. During filtration and extraction, the samples were kept dark as much as
 possible. After 24 hour extraction by acetone at -20 °C, the samples were brought to room
 temperature for an hour. Chlorophyll-a and phaeo-pigment levels were measured with a Turner
 Designs 10 AU-005 Field Fluorometer SN:5152FRXX. The sample was acidified with 2 drops of 1N
 hydrochloric acid to obtain the phaeo-pigment reading.

 Phytoplankton and bacterioplankton were collected in 2 ml capacity cryogenic vial and fixed with
 0.2 ml of 10% paraformaldehyde by vortex mixing. Samples were maintained for at least 15 min at
 laboratory temperature to allow fixation, and then stored at -80 degree C until analysis at the
 Bedford Institute of Oceanography. Cell concentrations of picophytoplankton, nanophytoplankton,
 and bacterioplankton (i.e. non-autofluorescent picoplankton) in thawed samples were analyzed by
 flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson FACSort) following protocols in routine use (Li and Dickie, 2001).

 Iodine 129 samples were collected into 1 L PVC bottles and returned to the Laboratory of the
 Atlantic Environmental Radioactivity Unit (AERU) at the Bedford Institute of Oceanography (BIO).
 In the laboratory, a NaI carrier was added to a 200 mL aliquot of the seawater sample, it was
 slightly acidified, purified using multiple hexane extractions and iodine was precipitated as NaI.
 The NaI precipitate was shipped to the IsoTrace Laboratory at the University of Toronto where 129I
 analyses were performed by accelerator mass spectrometry (Smith et al. 1998; 1999; 2005).

 Cesium 137 samples were collected into 10 L plastic carboys. The water samples were passed
 through a potassium ferrocyanide (KCFC) packed resin column in the laboratory (AERU) which
 quantitatively extracts 137Cs from seawater (Smith et al. 1990; Smith & Ellis 1995). The KCFC
 resin was deployed in a standard geometry and measured using a hyperpure Ge detector having an
 efficiency of 25%.

 Halocarbons: CFC-11 and CFC-12:
   Halocarbon samples were collected in a Perfektum 250 mL glass syringe (Popper & Sons Inc.).
   CFC-12 and CFC-11 were analyzed at sea on the Institute of Ocean Sciences automated purge
   and trap system. Separation and detection of the components was achieved using a 60 m,
