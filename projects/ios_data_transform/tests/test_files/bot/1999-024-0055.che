*COMMENTS
    Cruise 9924 water chemistry data :
    "Canadian Arctic Archipelago - August 23 - September 8, 1999"
    Field operations were carried out from the CCGS Sir Wilfrid Laurier
    CTD/Rosette casts were deployed from the boat deck using an A-frame and
    winch mounted on the port side.

    Determination of CTD data at bottle stops:
    Method of determination reviewed in December 2003 by Sarah
    Zimmermann. Data are from the downcast Guildline CTD, found by
    matching the SBE-19 upcast bottle trip pressures to the Guildline
    after correcting for the SBE-19 surface offset (1 to 2 db depending
    on station), sensor to bottle center offset (-0.6 db), and an
    additional offset of +0.2db. [Performed by Julie Bacle and
    Humfrey Melling]  It was determined by looking at the CTD and
    bottle salinities that no further offset was required to correct
    for the bottle flushing and fluid dynamics around the package.
    [Performed by Sarah Zimmermann]  The listed pressures are the
    applied corrections.
    Note : Some stations (FT1, FT3, BS2, BS3-test, JR1,JR4, JRL4,
    EI9, CI1) were missing SBE-19 bottle trip pressures.  For these
    stations, the Guildline CTD data were found by taking the records
    where bottle salinities matched the CTD salinities.  The nature
    of this method already accounts for the pressure offsets, thus
    no further corrections were required. [Performed by Mary O’Brien]
    Note : There are still some question Regarding CTD Salinity Calibration :
    Five stations (87, 88, 89, 91 and 92) show a 0.01 difference between
    CTD and bottles in the high salinity, deep water. See file
    report_199924_ctdbottlestopdata.doc for more detail.

    Temperature and bottle salinities at the bottle trip depths are included :
    Temperature_ITS68 and Salinity_PSS-78

    Dissolved Oxygen :
    Analyzed onboard the CCGS Sir wilfrid Laurier by Mary O'Brien		
     using an automated version of the Micro-Winkler Technique as described in :		
    "Carpenter, J. H., 1965.  The Chesapeake Bay Institute technique for the "		
    "Winkler dissolved oxygen method, Limnol. Oceanogr., 10, 141-3.  "		
    The titration is done using a Metrohn Dosimat 665 and the end point 		
    is detected using a Brinkmann probe colorimeter PC900.		
    The methodology is described by an internal OSAP document (Dissolved 		
    Oxygen Determination Methods and Procedures by Bernard Minkley and 		
    George Chase). Standard pooled deviation for 26 duplicates for the oxygen 		
    analysis is 0.034 mL/L.  Range for all data is 5.2 to 10.3 mL/L		
    "note - only the first of the duplicates is included in the archived data ie, no
    averaged data for dissolved oxygen is included in the archive.		

    Bottle salinities : 		
    Samples were brought back to IOS and analyzed using a Portasal 		
    (model 8410; Serial number 59724) which was standardized using		
    IAPSO standard seawater (batch P134).  Analysis done by Doug Sieberg.
    No duplicate samples were taken.

    "Nutrients : (silicate, nitrate plus nitrite and orthophosphate)"
    Samples were analyzed onboard by Janet Barwell-clarke.
    Nutrients  were analyzed using Technicon Autoanalyzer II components.
    Reactive silicate and nitrate plus nitrite were determined according to
    " Technicon Industrial Methods No. 186-71 W and 158-71 W respectively, and"
     soluble orthophosphate was determined using a modified Technicon method
    "as described in :  Brynjolfson, S.J., 1973.  A modification of the Technicon"
    "methodology for the determination of orthophosphate in seawater, "
    "Paper presented at Water Resources Services, Vancouver,  B.C."
    "The method is also described in an internal document : ""Institute of Ocean "
    "Sciences Nutrient Methods and Analysis"" by J. Barwell-Clarke and F Whitney "
    1996. Most of the samples were analyzed in duplicate and
    pooled standard deviations were calculated as follows :

    Silicate:		
    69 samples were analyzed in duplicate		
    "Pooled standard deviation for 699 pairs :  Sp=0.203 umol/L, n=69 "		
    (range for all data is 2.1 to 46.0 umol/L)		
    Archived data is the average of the duplicates.		

    Orthophosphate:		
    36 samples were analyzed in duplicate		
    "Pooled standard deviation for 36 pairs :  Sp=0.034 umol/L, n=36 "		
    (range for all data is 0.0 to 1.9 umol/L)		
    Archived data is the average of the duplicates.		

    Nitrate plus Nitrite:		
    69 samples were analyzed in duplicate		
    "Pooled standard deviation for 69 pairs:  Sp=0.07 umol/L, n=69 "	
    (range for all data is 0.0 to 17.0 umol/L)
    Archived data is the average of the duplicates.

    Oxygen isotopes :
    Samples were analyzed by The 'Stable Isotope Laboratory' at the University of
    Calgary as described in the file :  UofC_O18_analysis_description.doc
    The 18O/16O ratio was determined using the common CO2-H2O
    equilibration technique (Epstein, 1953; O'Neil et al., 1975) in which
    millimole quantities of CO2 are equilibrated with water samples
    under constant temperatures. Subsequently, the CO2 is cryogenically
    purified and analyzed mass spectrometrically for its 18O/16O ratio.
    Note that this technique measures the isotopic activity of 18O and not
    the actual 18O concentration. For dilute waters, differences between
    isotopic activity and concentration are negligible. For saline waters
    and brines, however, supplemental water chemistry data and longer
    equilibration times are needed to obtain true isotopic compositions
    (Horita, 1993; Sofer, 1972).

    CFC Measurements (analyst:  Nes Sutherland)
    CFC analysis was carried out on the IOS automated purge and trap system.
    Separation and detection of the components was achieved using a 60 m, 0.32 mm
    GasPro Gas separator fused silica column and a Hewlett Packard GC/Electron
    Capture Detector.  Standardization was done using a gas standard (S14) made
    at Brookhaven National Laboratories and standardized at Scripps Institute
    of Oceanography according to the SIO1993 scale. Analyses for CFC12, CFC11,
    CFC113, and CCl4 was carried out. Air samples were taken as a further check
    on the operation of the system.  All concentrations are reported in
    picomoles/litre. Note : the Methylene_chloride data is not calibrated to
    reference standards.
