    Materials and Methods
    ---------------------

    Total incident solar radiation was recorded on a Belfort pyrheliometer mounted
    on board ship, and extinction of surface light with depth was measured by a
    Montedoro-Whitney Underwater Illuminance meter (Model LMT-8A). The natural
    logarithm of light intensity was plotted against depth, and the slope of a
    straight line fitted to the points by, linear regression provided an estimate
    of the mean downward extinction coefficient (k). A standard 30-cm white Secchi
    disc was used to measure water transparency at every station.

    Temperature profiles to a depth of 50 m were obtained with a bathythermograph
    and surface temperatures were measured with a bucket thermometer.

    Water samples were collected from 1, 3, 5, and 20 m depths, and later analyzed
    for carbonate alkalinity, salinity, dissolved oxygen, nitrate (NO3-1), total
    phosphate (TPO4-3), and silicate (SiO4-4). The method of Strickland and Parsons
    (1968) was used to determine carbonate alkalinity, using an Orion digital pH
    meter (Model 801). However, if after acid titration final pH values fell below
    3.00, then the sample analysis was repeated using the APHA et al. (1971)
    standard titrimetric method. Salinity was analyzed with an Auto-lab salinometer
    (Model 601) to an accuracy of ±0.5‰. Density was computed by nomograph from
    temperature and salinity records. Dissolved oxygen (samples fixed within an
    hour of being taken) was determined by use of the Winkler titration method
    (Strickland and Parsons 1968). Samples for nutrient analysis were immediately
    frozen and later analyzed by the Environmental Protection Service analytical
    laboratory, Pacific Environment Institute, West Vancouver, using methods
    outlined in their manual (Fisheries/EPS 1974).

    The standard 14C method as initially proposed by Steemann-Nielsen (1952) was
    used, with some modifications. Water was collected from surface skim, and 0.5,
    1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, and 30 m depths using a 6-L polyvinyl chloride Van Dorn
    bottle. Productivity bottles (two 125 mL light and one 125 mL dark) were
    inoculated with 1 mL NaH14CO3. (37kBq.mL-1). For each experiment, the number
    of disintegrations.min-l (dpm).mL-l was determined by placing 1 mL in each of
    three scintillation vials. In most cases, samples were incubated in situ for
    4-5 h, normally from 0930 to 1430. Water was filtered through 0.45 µm BDH
    cellulose nitrate filters and placed in 10 mL of a specially prepared
    toluene-based fluor (POPOP, PPO, 2-ethoxyethanol, and toluene). Samples were
    analyzed within 24 h for activity in a Packard Tri-Carb Liquid Scintillation
    Spectrometer (Model 3375). The equation of Strickland (1960) was used to
    convert dpms to mg C. m-3. Using incident solar radiation for the entire light
    day and for the incubation period, data were converted to mg C. m-3 . d-l and
    integrated by a Hewlett-Packard Calculator and Plotter (Model 9820 A, 9862 A)
    to give phytoplankton production on an area basis (mg C.m-2.d-1). This involved
    linear interpolation between data points to the depths where light and dark
    uptake were equal.

    Detailed examination was made of phytoplankton samples from only 1 and 5 m
    depths to assess (a) species composition and (b) phytoplankton volumes during
    key spring and fall bloom periods. Phytoplankton samples were preserved in
    Lugol's, acetate solution and enumerated, usmg the Utermöhl (1958)
    sedimentation method. Volumes were determined by equating phytop1ankton cells
    to known geo-metric shapes. Each phytoplankton sample was examined under 175
    and 700X magnification using a Wild M40 inverted plankton microscope. Results
    were expressed as cells and totaI volume. m-3.

    One liter of sea water was taken for chlorophyll a analysis from I, 3, 5, and
    20 m depths and filtered onto 5.5-cm Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters with a
    small amount of MgCO3 added. Filters were macerated in a tissue grinder with
    10 mL of 90% acetone, and the filtrate analyzed on a Carr recording
    spectrophotometer (Model 15). The equation of Strickland and Parsons (1968)
    was used to calculate chlorophyll a.

    Vertical zooplankton hauls from 50 m were made at each station with a
    SCOR-UNESCO plankton net, with mouth diameter of 57 cm and screen mesh size of
    350 µm. Samples were preserved in 5% formaldehyde, returned to the laboratory,
    and split into two equal subsamples, One portion was dried overnight at 90ºC,
    and results expressed as zooplankton biomass in mg (dry weight) .m-3. The
    other portion was preserved for future reference.
