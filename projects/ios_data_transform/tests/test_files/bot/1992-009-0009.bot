            (not normally used).
        2 = Acceptable measurement (Flag 'b' also reported as ' ')
        3 = Questionable measurement (no problem observed in sampling or analysis,
            but value is not trusted, nonetheless; includes outlyers).
        4 = Bad measurement (known problem with sampling or analysis, but not
            serious enough to completely discard the value).
        5 = Not reported (lost sample; unredeemably bad measurement).
        6 = Mean of replicate measurements.
        7 = Manual chromatographic peak measurement.
        8 = Irregular digital chromatographic peak integration.
        9 = Sample not drawn for this measurement from this bottle (not normally used).

        CFC-11 and CFC-12 were analyzed using Gas Chromatography, following
        procedure of Bullister and Weiss (1987). In their current form, they not
        meet the relaxed WOCE standard for CFC's. Therefore the CFC qulaity flags
        have been given a value of'3'(questionable). The results are in raw form
        with no corrections applied as stated in the report. For CFC methods refer
        to the "Centre for Ocean Climate Chemistry Freon Data Report" located in the
        cruise .DOC directory.
